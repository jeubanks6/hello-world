“Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.”
My youth was spent in trailer parks and low-income housing. I always believed that I would live a life of meager means. After getting married and having a son I decided that to support my family I would join the US Army. In the Army I learned that I could be more than I had settled for. I took the discipline and training that I gained and am now using them to get a degree. I will achieve my goals and attain a career in cyber security that will not only provide for my family but also allow me to give my son a better life than I had.
